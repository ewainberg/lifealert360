This is a small JavaScript program that uses a life360 API to check if any members are within a distance of you.
I originally made this as a defensive measure for a game of [assassin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassin_(game)) that my high school class set up.
Alas, I still lost, but the program worked!
